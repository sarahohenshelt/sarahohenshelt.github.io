Out of the train station and we found a van taxi. 15 minutes later we were at our Airbnb. I had picked a place outside of town as the ones in town, that fit 6 were $600+ a night. This place was 1.5km from town and we figured we could walk or take numerous taxis a day and still come out ahead. This may have been one of my best picks! It was an old barn, constructed in 1853. Everything about it was adorable, even came with Santa hats AND there was a part about 50 meters away that we could see from the window at the dining room table. After the time at Robert's place outside Liege, the kids had been asking for a place with a backyard. As we were in the taxi, Ben kept asking specifics on 'how much outdoor space?' Everyone was thrilled when we got there. Kids were excited to claim the room with the single beds and loved that there was a closable hatch to close off the staircase so no one fell down in the middle of the night. It was going to be an awesome place for Christmas.
