Even though the trip to Sweden was short, if felt so good to be back on our apartment. I unpacked while the kids did some writing. Dan got home and did a bike ride with Sam back to the Kauppahalli, since our favorite place was out of salmon when we were there earlier that morning. This is becoming a family favorite. Easy to make and we still get a huge dose of salmon. Not ideal as it's kind of squishy, but we started using canned mango. Mangos here aren't great and SO expensive...and you have to plan days in advance AND time it just right to get them to be a little good.

Everyone so happy to be back home with Dad...or maybe it's the salmon that is making us all smile.

The next day was Vappu Eve. What is Vappu you ask? It's the biggest Finnish holiday where they celebrate the unofficial start of spring, because let' not lie, the end of March is hardly spring here. It's the biggest picnic day in the country and on Vappu Eve, a chosen department of a local university gets to put a graduation cap on a statue. I'm not lying. Then, when the cap gets put on the statue, everyone else puts their hats on too! When I say "graduation cap", I don't mean the one you see in the states. The Finnish graduation cap looks like a sailors cap with a huge tassel for certain majors. 

And if that all wasn't weird enough, never mind the fact that there are thousands of Fins all gathered and drinking champagne, most people were wearing one piece coveralls with patches all over them.

And the cool thing to do for the girls, it seemed, was to tie the top part around your waist. This wasn't necessarily a 'because it's hot' thing as many had them tied around their waists and then had jackets on.

They were really fun to see. All colors were being sported, which seemed to be linked to the school/degree the person went to.

The usual statue that got the cap was under restoration, so they moved the event and used a temporary statue. The statue is not bit and is pretty much hidden below the crane. And that's the awesome library in the background...an amazingly beautiful building, inside and out.

It was pretty crowded, so we didn't try to get close. We found a place to stand with a view while the kids ran around on the grass behind us until more people showed up and it was too crowded.

Because we are in Finland, the event started right on time. The capping was to happen at 4:30pm and the crane started moving about 15 minutes before, with about 10 students hanging from it.

There was a lot of slow moving around, some up and down...pretty much teasing the crowd, although I'm sure it happened right on time each year, so who did they think they were fooling? The place was so packed by now and everyone was waving their hats in the air with some chanting, right before the statue got the cap. And at that moment, everyone else put their caps on. According to a guy Dan works with, it is NOT okay to wear your cap before the statue. When we were waiting, we never saw someone with a cap.

The next day, May 1, the actual holiday, it was even more of a party at a park down by the water. Dan was told to get there early to get a good spot. When he asked 'early' meant, he was told you need to be there by 6am to get a good spot. Um, okay, we are good with a not good spot. We biked there, with half the city and the other half was walking or in their cars. You didn't need directions, just follow the mass of people. The bike ride had good parts and a few scary parts due to Max's quick turning of the handle bars when he things he's going to fall. Not fun when we were close to so many bikes and cars. But then there were lovely parts.

We parked our bikes in an area that seemed to be designated the end of the allowable biking. Bike were scattered everywhere, most just locked to themselves or an
