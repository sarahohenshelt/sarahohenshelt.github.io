In the Peak District National Park, there are tons of YHAs, think in the teens maybe? A lot are closed for the season or only open if you rent the WHOLE place, but the one outside Castleton was the one that caught Dan's eye the most. It was booked most nights so we were only able to get it for 2 nights. In hindsight, we should have just skipped it and stayed at the Hartington one 2 more nights and avoided a pack up/unpack day, but you know what they say about hindsight. It was so beautiful, kids had SO much space to roam and we could walk to town. Everything was great, but maybe because it was our 3rd in a row or because we only had 2 nights there, we didn't like it as much. I feel a bit bad saying this, because there was nothing wrong with it. Well, our room was the smallest so far without a view, so maybe that contributed...but we are never in the room, so who knows.

The drive was supposed to be 40 minutes, but there was a communication error between driver, navigator and google maps. :) Still under an hour with a wrong turn, even with google now on our side. We got in, but couldn't check in until 3pm.
