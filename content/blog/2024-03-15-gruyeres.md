Not much planned for this weekend, just wanted a place to escape our terrible AirBnb. I had rented a car thinking we'd do a easy mountain get away and easy it was! Our big suitcase and bike box were still and Yuhao's place. Dan biked to pick up the car and came back to get us. All checked out and loaded up, we headed to Gruyeres. With my back, I finally decided to risk the stress of Dan driving and me navigating. To be fair (to me), other people have told me what an amazing navigator I am. Numerous. Dan thinks I'm the worst. Anyways, in the car and driving out of town, Dan was already stressed. He said the guys at the rental place were rattling off rules for driving. Yellow buses always get the right of way, but not blue. Arrows in street mean right or way, or do they mean yield? This didn't help either.

Should I have driven, probably. 10 minutes into the drive and I realize when Dan ran up to grab the suitcases, he didn't grab our food in the fridge. It was a lot, and it was lunch, so we went back to get that. Tensions are high, but we make it out of town. Kids were planning something in the backseat together, which made for a pretty easy drive...and short.

We climbed a bit and the views of Lake Geneva were stunning!

And then a 90deg turn to the north and we were pointed right at the mountains.

So we were actually staying at the base of a small ski mountain about 5 minutes past Gruyeres. We were there in an hour. We could check in as I'm pretty sure we were the only overnight guests that night. The bonus of the shoulder season. Not ski season and not full hiking season yet. I guess it's snowshoe season, but doesn't seem to have a massive following. Our room was perfect, there was a communal kitchen and a playground right outside.

We ate lunch at the picnic tables and the kids played in the playground. Not wanting to get in the car again, but no wanting to sit around, we decided to hike right up the mountain. There were trails that more or less went right up the ski slopes and some that went around, but we went for high elevation gain, low distance covered.

Weather was perfect, but we could see clouds rolling in. You could see all the way up the valley.

As we were walking right up, we took lots of breaks. And to be honest, we are all a bit out of hiking shape. We've walked miles around cities, but not the same as walking up a mountain.

We got to the top and the weather turned. I really wanted to do a loop behind and around, but we weren't dressed for it and I think we were all tired after the week. Jackets on and Dan and Ben talked about this being the entrance to some Lord of the Rings place. J. R. R. Tolkien got some of his inspiration for places in the book from when he was hiking in Swizerland.

Since getting to the top, we walked about 10 minutes before we decided to turn around. Knowing energy was low before the hike, I had grabbed some Haribo gummies that the kids had loved when we were in France. Kids were lagging a bit, so I busted the out.

We got to where the trail started down again and now it was decently raining. Mountain hut behind us was oddly closed. Lack of skiers I suppose.

We made it back staying shockingly dry. I think it helped that the kids basically ran down the whole mountain. All they wanted to do was to go explore in the forrest by our place and play on the playground. Dan and Max ran to the store for supplies while I watched the other two play by the river. Luckily Dan did not buy this massive chunk of cheese, just used Max for scale.

He did buy the most flowered shaped lettuce ever though. The stalk below was so small and the leaves all fanned out perfectly.
