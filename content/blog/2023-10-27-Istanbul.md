There is so much to say about Istanbul, but overwhelming in every sense of the word is what comes to mind. Overall, it was totally an exhausting weekend and we were so done with the crowds, people pestering you to look in their shop, lack of places to walk safely (sidewalks were a joke) and worrying about losing a kid or having them hit by a car. The city seemed to go on forever and we didn’t even see that much! I told Dan, if we could do it again AND we had a lot more time in Turkey, we would have done 1 on 1 trips with the 2 older kids. The one-day Ben and I went out alone for an hour, solidified this idea. You could kinda walk holding one kid’s hand. I wasn’t always looking for a kid or asking Dan if he had “insert kid’s name here”. Sure it didn’t help that we were here on the 100th anniversary of Turkey being a republic, but I think the crowds were just as bad Monday after the holiday. 

Even when you feel totally prepared, it’s just one train ride and only 2 pieces of luggage, travel days seem to get us in the end. We headed out in the morning with plenty of time, not knowing how long it would take to get a taxi, and were feeling good when we got to the train station 50 minutes before our train left. Some walking around and continually checking when we could go down to our platform, and the time flew by. Unlike any other train station we have been to yet on this trip, this one had pass through security to enter the station, then you show ID to pass onto the platform for your pre-purchased train. Nice you don’t need to show the ticket, but it felt like one extra way the government could keep tabs.

We had a table for 4 of us and an extra seat across the aisle. We ended up having enough space, that we sat 3 in 2 chairs as Max and I colored and Dan read for the first bit, once we were done looking out the window as we left Ankara. It was a bit of a struggle, but Ben and Sam got some school work done. Probably not the best idea looking back with all the distractions of people and sights, but we tried.

A guy sitting across the aisle was so friendly and chatted with us for about 45 minutes. He teaches English, loves it he says, and was quite keen to chat with the kids too. When he got off, we ended up chatting with another super friendly guy. The kids took to him and were asking to be the one who got to sit next to him…in our seat across the aisle. Max got to the most and even wanted to read books to him. They face-timed with his girlfriend and he just listened to Max being Max.

Sam drew with him and played rock paper scissors. Sam ended up gifting him the drawing he did and in a sweet gesture, Sam’s new friend gave him a pen to remember him by. Random kind people make my day!

Arrived on time, so far so good. We found a taxi pretty easily; one that had backwards seats that the kids thought was just TOO cool.

As we were getting close to our place turned off to the small streets, it became a total gridlock. The streets weren’t big enough for 2 cars, yet there was no indication which way they went. We didn’t move for minutes at a time, then we backed up, then we waited, over and over. We finally got out, overpaid the driver so he could get out of the mess and walked the last 1.6km over crowded cobblestone sidewalks that were constantly blocked by something and we had to go into the street. Back on sidewalk, back into the street…you get the idea...and with out luggage. Saw this gem though.

We finally made it to our place after about 25minutes of walking, which was 100% faster than car could have made it. Great place, but man were we excited to get out and see! We headed towards the bazaar and everywhere you looked there was something to see! An old tower, ruins, a beautiful mosque (not even in the Lonely Planet). Kids were hungry so we grabbed some fresh squeezed pomegranate and orange juice on the walk. A bit stressful as the streets were just packed to the gills with vendors, pedestrians, carts. 

We eventually got to a non-car area and that helped with walking ability. Saw this very old and tall column. Thanks to the wide angle to Dan's camera (to get the whole thing in), we all look super tall and stretched out. The smiles are our face are so genuine...we were so happy to be walking around.

Continued walking to the Grand Bazaar and got a glimpse of the Hagia Sofia. Really any direction you looked, you saw something cool in the area we were in.

We got in the bazaar and it was a site! The rows of shops seemed to go on forever, or we were just being turned in circles that we could never find the exit. The ceilings were either painted or exposed wood beams. Turkish flags and banners everywhere. And as I said before, it went on forever, in EVERY direction!

Walked past a water fountain, that would end up being a meeting point for us later. Have I mentioned how much I love public water fountains?

We found a small courtyard in the back where food was being served. (Inside was all shops and some small cafes, but we needed food). Okay food, but it didn’t matter as we were all quite hungry.

With full tummies, we went back in and did a bit of Christmas shopping. We didn’t last long as it’s, as I said before, overwhelming. Back for a normal bedtime before the next day where we wanted to see a lot.

There really is just too much to see in this city, so we figured we start with a couple of the main sights. We had been talking about the Hagia Sofia for quite a while, so that was our first destination. With no food in the house, we stopped at a cafe for coffee and pastries. 

![Alt text](/images/travel6/PXL_20231028_053642367.jpg)

We walked up, taking it all in and then realized things were looking a little different than we had expected. Looked a bit newer, different colors too.

Then we had a lightbulb moment...we were at the Blue Mosque! They are both so big and we weren't totally playing attention to where we were going, we just walked to the biggest mosque we could see. Turns out it was the Blue Mosque and the even bigger Hagia Sofia was on the other side of the central area we were. Maybe we shouldn't have followed our trusty tour guide. :) My kids love maps and that makes me so happy.

![Alt text](/images/travel6/PXL_20231028_052426243.jpg)

With no rush, we sat down in the courtyard of the Blue Mosque and had the kids get out their field notes to write and/or draw about where we were and what we were seeing. It is so impressive to see and so much to take in. I wish so much I could read their minds and really know what they are thinking.

I walked around a bit and took some photos. I LOVE the architecture of mosques. I love the arches, the domes, the geometric designs, the LACK of paintings of people. The repeated arches and domes are so visually appealing to me that I could stare up for hours. Maybe just lay down and look up actually to save my neck.

![Alt text](/images/travel6/PXL_20231028_054500961.jpg)

Seriously, so beautiful and it seemed to exude peacefulness. Even the kids were chill as we were all sitting there.

Dan walked around to see about the line to get in. He reported back that there was a line, but not too bad. By the time we put the field notes away and walked to the entrance, all of 3 minutes, a GIANT tour group had showed up and now the line was quite long. It moved shockingly fast, really just a clothing check and a quick metal detector. And there was a cool tree for us to look at while we waited.

No words can describe the feeling you have when you walk in and are surrounded by the vastness of it all! The colors, the symmetry, the shapes, everything. Beautiful and amazing don't even begin to describe it.

![Alt text](/images/travel6/PXL_20231028_061611376.jpg)

And the fact that there are no paintings of bloodied bodies on crosses or any of the millions of paintings we have seen in churches and cathedrals, well it makes it a much more peaceful experience for me. I have walked into too many churches in the last few months and been totally turned off at some of the sights inside. Some too vivid, too bright, too disturbing. But here, just geometric beauty and I love it. Maybe it's because I'm an engineer or because I don't believe in God, but whatever it is, I love it.

About half of the place is roped off for prayer, including the center part where a huge circular chandelier (I think it would still be called this), with numerous circles of lights hanging down from way up high.

Kids had been so quiet and we weren't going to push our luck...and more and more people seemed to keep coming in than were going out. So we grabbed our shoes, frantically reminded kids to not even step an inch on the carpet with them on and headed to a restaurant for a bigger breakfast.

![Alt text](/images/travel6/PXL_20231028_063916067.MP.jpg)

It was a cafe on top with a shop below, so I took some time to look at the towels and robes. Not wanting to travel with stuff for us, I was really looking for family and friends. I got my sister, Erin, a tea towel. She loves having them from different places.

Food was great. We got a kahvalti for 2 and a couple additional dishes. Mine came with accordion cheese!

The area we were walking around had a few of the big main sites, but also everywhere you looked, there was something else to see. My parents came to Turkey about 8 years ago and my Dad said their tour guide told them that there are more Roman Ruins in Turkey than Rome, more Greek ruins in Turkey than Greece. It sounded hard to believe, but I'm kind of understanding that quote a bit more. Maybe not 100% true, but from what we've seem around Turkey and now in Istanbul, I get it.

![Alt text](/images/travel6/PXL_20231028_075723727.jpg)

We found the Hagia Sofia and the line was SO long and not moving. With so much else to see, we opted to save that for another day and go to the Basilica Cistern
