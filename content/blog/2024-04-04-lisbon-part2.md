The next morning I headed to the store to get some food and had a bit of fun with the fruit. The light green bumpy fruit was a joy to find. I had some of these in Peru years ago, but never learned the name. Not knowing what they were, a fruit seller on the street cut us up one to try and we ended up buying a few. I was thrilled to find them! And couldn't resist some passion fruits.

We had yogurt with fruit overload for breakfast and started out on our day. Jess/Dave crew were hanging with their family, so we decided to head along the coast towards Belem. We started out with a view down over the port, before starting down the steps to sea level.

And then down we went.

Shenanigans by the port.

We didn't actually know the exact route, so we kept heading towards the water and then were going to run right. We weren't sure if this was was a dead end or not (with the shipping port) but we found a swing bridge that we wanted to cross. We waited patiently, as it was open as a boat had just passed.

We crossed, figured out that we couldn't continue on the shore that way and then crossed back. Still walking along the water, just not on the port side. We had the Ponte 25 de Abril (aka the Portuguese Golden Gate Bridge) in view and quickly arrived beneath it. Interestingly enough, the base was a giant hinge. No column continuous to the foundation with the base plate connected to the column. Assuming they didn't want to create any moment
