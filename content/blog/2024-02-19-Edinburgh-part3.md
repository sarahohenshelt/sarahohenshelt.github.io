Edinburgh was really feeling like home. I no longer needed a phone to get me anywhere, I had the staples I'd grab at the grocery store when I was out and I seemed to do laundry every day. It really hit me as we were happily walking home on a dark night along old streets. I loved this city and knew it wasn't going to be fun to leave. We were in such a great place and we had a routine down. We were so close to things that made it easy to just pop out to do something and come back if needed.
