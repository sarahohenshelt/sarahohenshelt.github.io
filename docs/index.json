We had a big walking day the day before (around Nice) and were 2 days post trans-Atlantic flight, but it was really our only day to go to Monaco…and I was so curios to see it. We took a hot and crowded bus there and went straight to the central market for food. Kids found a playground and Dan and I were able to sit and drink a coffee in the plaza and be close enough to see the kids.","date":"2023-07-09T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://travelingengineer.com/blog/2023-07-09-monaco/","tags":null,"title":"Monaco"},{"author":null,"categories":null,"contents":"True to myself, I woke up in a new city and I was ready to go explore! I have traveled with kids a lot and have created the rule of thumb…whatever you have planned, divide by 2. The ‘plan’ was to hike up to a fort with some views, walk to our cousin’s (Mark and Shayna) place, tram to their new place, swing by the market for street food, go to a water fountain, stroll the streets of old town and maybe a quick dip in the sea before dinner.","date":"2023-07-07T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://travelingengineer.com/blog/2023-07-07-nice/","tags":null,"title":"Nice"},{"author":null,"categories":null,"contents":"The “Plan” I put this in quotation marks as it has already changed numerous times from when the seed got planted back in September 2022 and it will continue to change.
