Supposed to be…we were all optimistic with the border crossing into Bosnia and Herzegovina being 5 minutes, but not so much heading into Montenegro. At the border, times were getting dire. Kids were hungry, but we didn’t want to bust out all the food in the car and usually Harry Potter reading will suffice, but nothing worked…and 4 of us had to go to the bathroom.","date":"2023-07-31T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://travelingengineer.com/blog/2023-07-31-montenegro/","tags":null,"title":"Montenegro"},{"author":null,"categories":null,"contents":"After our late lunch in Pocitelj, the kids pretty much went right to bed once we checked into our apartment.\nI made a quick run to the grocery store in the morning so we could do breakfast in, some school work and then head out to explore a bit. We were 2 blocks from the river and had lots of tree lined streets to walk down. We crossed a bridge and headed into the old town.","date":"2023-07-27T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://travelingengineer.com/blog/2023-07-27-trebinje/","tags":null,"title":"Trebinje"},{"author":null,"categories":null,"contents":"Max and I took the bus to the airport to get the rental car and then swung back to get the rest of them. I just couldn’t handle us all loading stuff on a bus and getting all sweaty so early…and it worked out for Dan to get some school time in with the 2 older kids.\nAs we are starting the drive and just getting out of town, Dan asks if I want the scenic route or the highway.","date":"2023-07-26T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://travelingengineer.com/blog/2023-07-26-pocitelj/","tags":null,"title":"Pocitelj"},{"author":null,"categories":null,"contents":"The age-old story when backpacking through Europe…you land at 7am, but can’t check in until 3pm. Our Airbnb host said we could at least drop our stuff off at 11am. With heat, 3 kids and luggage, 4 hours seemed like eternity. We started off by finding a restaurant, piling our stuff up and getting some food. 45 minutes down. It was hot, so we thought a museum would be a good idea.","date":"2023-07-22T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://travelingengineer.com/blog/2023-07-22-split/","tags":null,"title":"Split"},{"author":null,"categories":null,"contents":"All the holding up of the Pisa Tower tuckered these kids out. :)\nAnd it seems the car was concerned about my tireness because it let me know I had been driving for an hour and needed a coffee. Only in Italy!\nAs we turned off the autostrada (fast tollway) and followed our trusty google maps, we could see a tower and a castle way off in the distance on top a giant hill.","date":"2023-07-20T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://travelingengineer.com/blog/2023-07-20-san-marino/","tags":null,"title":"San Marino"},{"author":null,"categories":null,"contents":"For months Sam has been talking about seeing the Leaning Tower of Pisa. I have seen it and it wasn’t high on my list to see again, but the excitement he had about seeing it made me want to fit it in. I don’t think we would have gone too far out of our way to see it, but it was only a 20 min train ride from where our ferry docked and we knew it would be late by the time we got there…meaning we wouldn’t want to continue on to San Marino that day.","date":"2023-07-19T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://travelingengineer.com/blog/2023-07-19-pisa/","tags":null,"title":"Pisa"},{"author":null,"categories":null,"contents":"Getting to Corsica from Genoa was a trek! We had a 7:45am train to catch, so at 7am we were walking to an area we had seen taxis the day before. (No cars were allowed where our Airbnb was, so we had to get past the square area. No taxis. We started walking in the direction of the train station and for 20minues a taxi never passed us. Oh well. Got food for the kids and by 7:30am we were on the platform with fed kids and sweaty parents.","date":"2023-07-14T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://travelingengineer.com/blog/2023-07-14-corsica/","tags":null,"title":"Corsica"},{"author":null,"categories":null,"contents":"This time I swore after a big day we were going to have a chill one. Morning at a pirate ship, lunch at home and maybe some afternoon wandering around. It did not go as planned.\nAfter breakfast at home of yogurt and bananas we were off to the pirate ship. On the way we checked out the deterioration of some columns and saw talked about the order of how part of it was patched.","date":"2023-07-12T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://travelingengineer.com/blog/2023-07-12-genoa/","tags":null,"title":"Genoa"},{"author":null,"categories":null,"contents":"When your good friend from high school is in Florence and you are in Genoa at the same time, how do you not meet in the middle in Cinque Terra? We planned to take the direct 9:54am train but when we got there to buy tickets, it was sold out! We would have had to wait an hour and had a transfer. If we weren’t meeting up with Rona and family, we would have just postponed for another day.","date":"2023-07-11T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://travelingengineer.com/blog/2023-07-11-cinque-terra/","tags":null,"title":"Cinque Terra"},{"author":null,"categories":null,"contents":"By 8am, when I was up starting to pack, it was hot (sense a theme here) and I was already sweating. I tried to move slow, but anytime I was in the sun, it was hard not to. We planned to walk the 400m to the bus stop with our stuff when our Airbnb host seems to think that was a bit much and offered to drive the stuff. Dan went with the stuff and the kids and I walked down.","date":"2023-07-10T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://travelingengineer.com/blog/2023-07-10-travel-to-genoa/","tags":null,"title":"Travel Day to Genoa"},{"author":null,"categories":null,"contents":"This was a bit of a forced day. We had a big walking day the day before (around Nice) and were 2 days post trans-Atlantic flight, but it was really our only day to go to Monaco…and I was so curios to see it. We took a hot and crowded bus there and went straight to the central market for food. Kids found a playground and Dan and I were able to sit and drink a coffee in the plaza and be close enough to see the kids.","date":"2023-07-09T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://travelingengineer.com/blog/2023-07-09-monaco/","tags":null,"title":"Monaco"},{"author":null,"categories":null,"contents":"True to myself, I woke up in a new city and I was ready to go explore! I have traveled with kids a lot and have created the rule of thumb…whatever you have planned, divide by 2. The ‘plan’ was to hike up to a fort with some views, walk to our cousin’s (Mark and Shayna) place, tram to their new place, swing by the market for street food, go to a water fountain, stroll the streets of old town and maybe a quick dip in the sea before dinner.","date":"2023-07-07T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://travelingengineer.com/blog/2023-07-07-nice/","tags":null,"title":"Nice"},{"author":null,"categories":null,"contents":"The “Plan” I put this in quotation marks as it has already changed numerous times from when the seed got planted back in September 2022 and it will continue to change.
