      <description>Ohrid Arriving into the bus station, we easily grabbed a taxi. We didn’t have Macedonian Dinar yet, but they would take euros (bills only, or paper as the guy stated). We were out of paper euros, but Ben had some. Once again, we had to raid Ben’s euro savings for something.
We got dropped off at the upper gate and followed picture directions (photos with arrows on them) from our Airbnb host.</description>

      <description>Another long goodbye as the kids had taken quite a liking to the bed and breakfast owners and visa versa.
We got help carrying out suitcases us the stairs to the car and we were off. Easy 3hr drive to Tirana, I dropped everyone off at the Airbnb and drove to the hotel to drop off the car. Due to a suggestion from the guy at the rental place, I took the bus back to the city center and then walked to our place.</description>

      <description>Our place was amazing! Right in the heart of it all, in an old renovated building with a large terrace out back and the sweetest couple that owned/ran it.
We needed food and the owner had recommended a place, Taverna Murgana. We walked about 4 minutes, through the bazaar to above the mosque. The place was just what we needed. A back patio with no other patrons outside…we were still pretty early.</description>

      <description>After our long goodbyes, we started out drive to Gjirokaster. We were in a critical part of Harry Potter, The Goblet of Fire and the kids and I were completely engrossed, begging Dan to keep reading. I never read the Harry Potter books, but always planned to when/if I had kids. I want to state I was NEVER against the books, but 7 books in a set would have taken a lot of time and when I start a series, I can’t stop!</description>

      <description>A UNESCO World Heritage site and nick named ‘The Town of a Thousand Windows’. Seeing photos and knowing it’s significance, this was clearly going to be a stop on our trip. I had planned to spend a few nights there, but looking back, I think we did it right with a day trip from magical Alpeta Winery. An easy 30 minute drive down the mountain and we were there. Found street parking (that we hoped was, and was, allowed) and started walking to the center.</description>

      <description>I want to start this post with talking about how I have never (and I mean never and I&amp;rsquo;ve traveled a LOT) felt so welcomed into a country as I/we have in Albania. Within minutes my kids are on hugging terms with waiters and people from where we stayed. Older people would walk up to us in the streets, bend down to the kids level and start speaking to the kids (in Albanian) with huge smiles on their faces.</description>

      <description>We had to return the rental car by noon to Podgorica, but really wanted to stop at Lipa Cave on the way as other days in Lovcen National Park, we just didn’t want to leave. The first tour of the day was 10am and lasted an hour. Drive to our Podgorica hotel was 45minutes and another 20 to the airport…what could go wrong? Oh and we needed gas.
I really didn’t want to have the 10am tour fill up, so I wanted to leave by 8:30 to get there by 9:15 to be safe.</description>

      <description>The drive from Trebinje, Bosnia and Herzegonia to Centije, Montenegro was supposed to be a little over 2 hours. Supposed to be…we were all optimistic with the border crossing into Bosnia and Herzegovina being 5 minutes, but not so much heading into Montenegro. At the border, times were getting dire. Kids were hungry, but we didn’t want to bust out all the food in the car and usually Harry Potter reading will suffice, but nothing worked…and 4 of us had to go to the bathroom.</description>

      <description>After our late lunch in Pocitelj, the kids pretty much went right to bed once we checked into our apartment.
I made a quick run to the grocery store in the morning so we could do breakfast in, some school work and then head out to explore a bit. We were 2 blocks from the river and had lots of tree lined streets to walk down. We crossed a bridge and headed into the old town.</description>

      <description>Max and I took the bus to the airport to get the rental car and then swung back to get the rest of them. I just couldn’t handle us all loading stuff on a bus and getting all sweaty so early…and it worked out for Dan to get some school time in with the 2 older kids.
As we are starting the drive and just getting out of town, Dan asks if I want the scenic route or the highway.</description>

      <description>The age-old story when backpacking through Europe…you land at 7am, but can’t check in until 3pm. Our Airbnb host said we could at least drop our stuff off at 11am. With heat, 3 kids and luggage, 4 hours seemed like eternity. We started off by finding a restaurant, piling our stuff up and getting some food. 45 minutes down. It was hot, so we thought a museum would be a good idea.</description>

      <description>All the holding up of the Pisa Tower tuckered these kids out. :)
And it seems the car was concerned about my tireness because it let me know I had been driving for an hour and needed a coffee. Only in Italy!
As we turned off the autostrada (fast tollway) and followed our trusty google maps, we could see a tower and a castle way off in the distance on top a giant hill.</description>

      <description>For months Sam has been talking about seeing the Leaning Tower of Pisa. I have seen it and it wasn’t high on my list to see again, but the excitement he had about seeing it made me want to fit it in. I don’t think we would have gone too far out of our way to see it, but it was only a 20 min train ride from where our ferry docked and we knew it would be late by the time we got there…meaning we wouldn’t want to continue on to San Marino that day.</description>

      <description>Getting to Corsica from Genoa was a trek! We had a 7:45am train to catch, so at 7am we were walking to an area we had seen taxis the day before. (No cars were allowed where our Airbnb was, so we had to get past the square area. No taxis. We started walking in the direction of the train station and for 20minues a taxi never passed us. Oh well. Got food for the kids and by 7:30am we were on the platform with fed kids and sweaty parents.</description>

      <description>This time I swore after a big day we were going to have a chill one. Morning at a pirate ship, lunch at home and maybe some afternoon wandering around. It did not go as planned.
After breakfast at home of yogurt and bananas we were off to the pirate ship. On the way we checked out the deterioration of some columns and saw talked about the order of how part of it was patched.</description>

      <description>When your good friend from high school is in Florence and you are in Genoa at the same time, how do you not meet in the middle in Cinque Terra? We planned to take the direct 9:54am train but when we got there to buy tickets, it was sold out! We would have had to wait an hour and had a transfer. If we weren’t meeting up with Rona and family, we would have just postponed for another day.</description>

      <description>By 8am, when I was up starting to pack, it was hot (sense a theme here) and I was already sweating. I tried to move slow, but anytime I was in the sun, it was hard not to. We planned to walk the 400m to the bus stop with our stuff when our Airbnb host seems to think that was a bit much and offered to drive the stuff. Dan went with the stuff and the kids and I walked down.</description>

      <description>This was a bit of a forced day. We had a big walking day the day before (around Nice) and were 2 days post trans-Atlantic flight, but it was really our only day to go to Monaco…and I was so curios to see it. We took a hot and crowded bus there and went straight to the central market for food. Kids found a playground and Dan and I were able to sit and drink a coffee in the plaza and be close enough to see the kids.</description>

      <description>True to myself, I woke up in a new city and I was ready to go explore! I have traveled with kids a lot and have created the rule of thumb…whatever you have planned, divide by 2. The ‘plan’ was to hike up to a fort with some views, walk to our cousin’s (Mark and Shayna) place, tram to their new place, swing by the market for street food, go to a water fountain, stroll the streets of old town and maybe a quick dip in the sea before dinner.</description>

      <description>The “Plan” I put this in quotation marks as it has already changed numerous times from when the seed got planted back in September 2022 and it will continue to change. But I will update it regularly so you can know where we at least think we might be in the future and where we have been.

      <description>We visited family before our jaunt across the pond. This meant we had an 8hr flight to Frankfurt, not a longer one from the West Coast. Pro: Less time on airplane. Con: Kids sleep great, but with dinner, there was no way to get anything more than 5hrs of sleep for them…1 for me.
With a big of a delayed flight and customs, we didn’t have much time. Bathroom yes, coffee for Dan no.</description>

      <guid>https://travelingengineer.com/blog/2023-07-01-packing/</guid>
      <description>I consider myself a humble person when it comes to most things, but packing…I will brag about my skills all day long. 2 week trip to Europe for myself and 3 kids in 2 carry-ons? With cold weather clothes and marathon outfit? No problem. Backpacking trip for the 5 of us to all fit in Dan’s backpack? With snow gear? In my sleep. But packing for a year for the family and still being able to move about…I struggled with this.</description>
