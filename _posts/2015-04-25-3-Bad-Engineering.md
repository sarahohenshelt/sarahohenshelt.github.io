I’m not sure when it all started, the love for traveling that is.  Maybe it was after my first trip to Europe or maybe it was wanting to see things I had seen in books or maybe it was just plain curiosity.  Whatever it was, it became an addiction.  I wanted to go everywhere, see everything, eat everything and climb every mountain.

I do however know when my love for engineering started.  As a kid I loved tall things, building things, math was easy for me and my parents were engineers that built cool things, so why would I not want to be an engineer?  Luckily for me, all of the above are still true.

I began to combine these two things I enjoy.  I found myself planning trips to see ancient ruins; being amazed at how they were still standing and standing well.  And in contrast to these amazing feats, I would always come across bad engineering and be quite confused that it hadn’t fallen down days, if not centuries ago.

I am currently a civil engineer practicing in the San Francisco Bay Area and traveling as much as I can. When I was 25 I decided I was going to go to 30 countries before I turned 30.  I celebrated my 30th birthday in Colombia, my 34th country to visit.    I am currently at 42.
