After a very crowded bus ride (pretty typical during my South American travels) we arrived to Pisac, a small village in the Sacred Valley.  Above the town are Incan Ruins, though incredible in their own way with agricultural terraces and many groups of ruins, never got the hype that Machu Picchu received.  Because of this you can hike through without the rules (change the wording) 

My mom, my dad, Uncle Roy, Kori and myself, took a cab to the top and for the next few hours found our way down though the ruins on paths.  Had lunch with view, sitting in what could have been an ancient dining room. Most likely it was the bedroom, dining room and kitchen. 

Though most of the ruins looked very well built, we came across this contradiction.  I'm assuming a cheaper contractor was picked for the left wall...or maybe the code was updated in 1520 and the old wall was not retrofitted.
